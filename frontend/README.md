# Frontend

### Using UI
* Open the html file in the browser, directly.
* Start typing :)
* Chat will be closed, if you receive 'bye' from the server.

### WorkFlow
* As it is loaded, it will create a new conversation by making POST request.
* On success, the socket connection is established.
* Maybe we can add closing the connection as well.
